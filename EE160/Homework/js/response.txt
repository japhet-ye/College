    This homework has taught me that directions can be interpereted in many differet ways ( for me and my partner had to practically decipher what the directions had to say and certain contradictions in the directions), and also how computers compute irrational numbers through famous series that give a certain degree of accuracy. My Calculus II professor did mention the Taylor Series and the Gregory-Liebniz Series in class and its applications in computers and the overall purpose of series is to be used as definitions for irrational numbers because certain series have "interesting" results and those "interesting" results are irrational numbers. So through the logic of the summation series, computers can compute to a certain degree of what PI, ln2, sinx, and cosx can be.
    I did do some code by myself and used Sam's code as a reference, but in the end, we are turning in Sam's code because it is much more refined and has a better logic to it, and I really could not finish steps 5 and 6 in the time that I had. I did do the "hand"-calculations (more like calculator calculations) which we used to test some cases. One important thing to note that Sam's code (and to an extent mine as well) does not compute any angles in radians above 9 because the functions that we came up with did not subtract intervals of 2PI or PI because that is what is theroetically supposed to happen when you input anything larger than 2PI. Also, there was descrepancies in the directions where in step one, the second bullet point states to let the user enter x in degrees, while the original step states to let the user enter radians. This is what caused a lot of confusion in the group and instead everything needs to be computed in radians. 
    One question that I have is that on normal calculators (well the calculators that I have), the biggest factorial input is 69!, anything above that will return a "MATH" error when in reality it is an overflow error, while the factorial function (the factorial function from scratch) can handle up until 170, is this due to hardware limitations and what exactly is this limitation?(also group name change request to JS instead of JS^2)
