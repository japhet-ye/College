16/30 works correctly
    Deductions:
        2 bad tabbing -- see code for correction
        
        3 output not written to file
        
        3 real roots case missed -- see code for correction
        
        5 no solution case not handled at all (a=b=0)
        
        1 complex roots not formatted nicely
            -actually compute the real and imaginary parts
            -or format it better, don't just mash nubmers together
        
    Comments:
        consider using elses
        
        tab your code so it's easy to see the blocks
        Also, you actaully have to put in returns when vi pops you down one line
        if you're typing too much
        
        for linear answers, it'd be better to leave second root blank rather than
        0
    
5/5  names in files
    Deductions:
    Comments: 
        it'd be good to put your actual name and date too

5/5  code commented
    Deductions:
    Comments:    

8/10 hand calculations
    Deductions:
        2 didn't do complex or single root(i.e. linear) examples
    Comments:
        a text file would of been apreciated
        
        also turn in the files together as per the instructions
    
5/10 results from code
    Deductions:
        1 hard to read
        2 not enough examples
            -supposed to be 10, only 5 were done
        2 only tested 2 real roots
    Comments:
        I'm not sure how this code was generated
    
        also turn in the files together as per the instructions
    
5/10 commentary
    Deductions:
        5 no algorithm
    Comments:
        I'll give you points for this, but it's a little strange as it's
        incorporated into your individual commentaries as well. There should be
        a specific team commentary and then individual commentaries
