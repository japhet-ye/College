COMMENTS: (required)
We had a bit of trouble with the chip minimization and counting,
but we hope that our process is correct. We did address some
problems as addressed in the previous homework grading such as not
reciting the problem or explaining how we got to that specific action as a whole
team and as a whole it is going fine as it is.
